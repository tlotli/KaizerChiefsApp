                          <p>Makua tells Goal that Ekstein is one player who needs to prove himself more after battling for consistency this season

Former midfielder Frank Makua has urged several Kaizer Chiefs players to raise their game and prove their worth in the team's remaining five league matches of the season.

Amakhosi are set to lock horns with University of Pretoria and Mamelodi Sundowns in their next two league games as they look to end their winless streak.</p>


<p>“This is the right time for the likes of (Hendrick) Ekstein to show what they can do for Chiefs. They need to do well in the upcoming games," Makua told Goal.

"For me, Ekstein has not done enough in the games he has played so far and he must prove that he is ready to be a true legend at Chiefs. Maybe this was the season for him to adapt and he could do much better next season," he said.

Makua added that there's no better time for Chiefs to face Sundowns than now, especially as they are still smarting from their exit in both the Caf Champions League and Nedbank Cup.</p>


<p>“They have a chance to win two consecutive matches against AmaTuks and Sundowns who are going through a slump now,” adds Makua.

“What's important is that the season will end soon and Steve Komphela will finally get a chance to buy his own players.

“This has been a poor season by Chiefs' standards and surely things will improve a lot with the chairman having said they will buy new players,” Makua concluded.</p>
