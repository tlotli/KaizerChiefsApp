                          <p>Chiefs have been heavily criticised for their dealings in recent transfer windows, after numerous free agents were signed.

“When you talk about Chiefs, you are talking about a very kind of special player that can match the requirements of Chiefs,” Dumitru told Goal.

“Now the market is very, very average because they don’t develop those high standard young players.

“So how do you expect the team to improve match expectations if their quality of players they bring in is not of a particular level?

Dumitru made mention of Spanish giants, Barcelona, who only sign players that fits the profile of the team’s tradition.

“Let’s make an example of Barcelona. They cannot buy a lot of players from all sides because they need a special type of player that is in line with the tradition of the club.” Dumitru said.

He added that he's sometimes amazed by the players linked with Amakhosi.

“At the moment, I am reading a lot of supporters talking about which players Chiefs should sign and so forth and well, it’s quite embarrassing when you look at those names.

“They are all good players no question about it but I can’t find one that comes to the level of a top player.

“So, that is a problem Chiefs are facing now because I can’t find one youngster that comes to the level of someone like Siphiwe Tshabalala,” Dumitru said.</p>





<p>“They have a chance to win two consecutive matches against AmaTuks and Sundowns who are going through a slump now,” adds Makua.

“What's important is that the season will end soon and Steve Komphela will finally get a chance to buy his own players.

“This has been a poor season by Chiefs' standards and surely things will improve a lot with the chairman having said they will buy new players,” Makua concluded.</p>
